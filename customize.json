  "wishText": "Happy Valentine’s Day my beautiful girl 🤍 I just want you to know how much I love you. I love you soooo much, bebe. Like actually more than I can even explain. You mean the world to me and I adore you more than you’ll ever understand. Every day with you feels special, and I’m so grateful that I get to call you mine. You’re honestly the best girlfriend ever. The way you care, the way you laugh, the way you just exist makes my life so much more loving and happy. Being with you feels warm and safe, and I wouldn’t trade that for anything. We’re actually so cute together and I love what we have. I want to take care of you, support you, and love you forever. I want to be there for you on your best days and your worst days. I promise to always try my best for you, because you deserve that and so much more. Thank you for being my girl, my comfort, my happiness. I love you endlessly, always and forever 🤍🤍🤍",
